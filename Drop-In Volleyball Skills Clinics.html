<div class="about-league">
    <h3>About Drop-In Volleyball Skills Clinics:</h3>
    <p>
        Welcome to our “Drop-In Skills Clinics” program—your opportunity to improve fundamental techniques, gain confidence in gameplay, 
        and steadily progress toward more advanced team strategies. These sessions are designed to fit players at various skill levels, 
        from beginners refining their first pass to intermediate players mastering rotations and transitioning into complex offensive and defensive formations. 
        No long-term commitments are required; you can attend all sessions or just the ones that match your goals.
        <p>
    <p><strong>Skill  Clinic Highlights:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Goals and Objectives:</strong><br>
        Our main objective is to help each participant build a strong foundation in core volleyball skills (passing, 
        serving, setting, hitting, and basic defensive play), then gradually layer in more complex elements like advanced 
        offensive systems, defensive alignments, and transitional footwork. We aim to foster an environment that emphasizes 
        skill progression, quality repetitions, constructive feedback, and a positive, inclusive atmosphere, aligning with coaching best practices
    </p>
   <p><strong>Cost and Payments:</strong><br>
    <strong>Cost per Session:</strong> $12<br>
    <strong>Full 10-Session Bundle:</strong> $100 (a $20 discount)
</p>
<p>
    Payments can be made securely via:<br>
    <strong>Venmo:</strong> @eric-bozoian<br>
    <strong>PayPal:</strong> Eric.Bozoian@gmail.com or 603-391-9226
</p>
<p>
    Participants are encouraged to prepay to secure their spot, as space is limited.
</p>
  <p><strong>Session Structure and Format:</strong><br>
    Each session lasts approximately 90 minutes to 2 hours and is designed to provide a balanced progression of activities:
</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; list-style-type: disc; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left;">
    <li><strong>Warm-Up:</strong> Dynamic stretches and light ball-handling exercises to prepare physically and mentally.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill-Focused Drills:</strong> Targeted exercises emphasizing one or two key skills (e.g., passing fundamentals, serving consistency, or hitting techniques).</li>
    <li><strong>Small-Sided Activities:</strong> Controlled scenarios where players apply newly learned skills in modified gameplay situations.</li>
    <li><strong>Short Scrimmage:</strong> A structured scrimmage focusing on integrating the session’s targeted skill into a real-game context.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback & Q&A:</strong> Coaches provide individualized feedback and encourage players to ask questions, ensuring everyone leaves with clear next steps.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
    This structure follows educational guidelines that recommend skill isolation followed by practical application, as endorsed by coaching resources like 
    <em>The Art of Coaching Volleyball</em> and <em>USA Volleyball</em>.
</p>

<p><strong>Structured Skills Curriculum Training Path:</strong><br>
    Our 10-session curriculum is divided into progressive phases, ensuring that each participant can start at their current skill level and advance at a comfortable pace:
</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; list-style-type: disc; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left;">
    <li><strong>Sessions 1-3 (Novice to Novice Plus):</strong> Focus on foundational skills—passing stance and platform control, basic serving technique, and proper setting footwork.</li>
    <li><strong>Sessions 4-7 (Intermediate):</strong> Introduce more dynamic elements—improved hitting approaches, consistent serve-receive formations, fundamental offensive systems (e.g., 5-1 or 6-2), and better defensive reads.</li>
    <li><strong>Sessions 8-10 (Intermediate Plus and Advanced):</strong> Explore complex strategies—blocking fundamentals, advanced defensive alignments, transitions, quick offensive sets, and back-row attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
    Participants can attend all 10 sessions for a full progression or select individual sessions that target the skills they need most. 
    Each session stands alone, but attending multiple sessions ensures a well-rounded skill set.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #d9534f;">&#9888;&#65039; What you are required to bring / wear: &#9888;&#65039;</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    To ensure a smooth and productive training experience, participants are required to bring appropriate gear for each session, based on whether it is held indoors or outdoors:
</p>

<!-- Indoor Sessions -->
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: left;">For Indoor Sessions:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; list-style-type: disc; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left;">
    <li><strong>Volleyball:</strong> Each participant must bring their own indoor volleyball. A standard indoor volleyball is required to allow for consistent drills and gameplay. If unsure, a ball labeled “indoor” or a regulation “size 5” volleyball is ideal. Avoid replica balls as they will fall apart quickly. You get the quality ball you pay for, so if you get a cheaper ball it will not last long.</li>
    <li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Athletic shoes are required.</li>
    <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Comfortable, breathable athletic clothing (e.g., T-shirts, shorts, or leggings) that allows for full range of motion during dives, jumps, and lunges.</li>
    <li><strong>Knee Pads (Optional but Recommended):</strong> Knee pads offer added protection for frequent diving and sliding, especially for beginner and intermediate players still learning defensive techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Bottle:</strong> Staying hydrated is critical during intense drills and scrimmages. Bring a refillable water bottle to keep yourself fueled throughout the session.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Outdoor Sessions -->
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: left;">For Outdoor Grass and Sand Sessions:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; list-style-type: disc; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left;">
    <li><strong>Volleyball:</strong> Participants must bring their own outdoor volleyball. Outdoor volleyballs are slightly heavier and more durable than indoor balls, allowing for better performance in wind and weather conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Shoes:</strong><br>
        <strong>For grass sessions:</strong> Wear athletic grass shoes. <span style="color: #d9534f;">DO NOT</span> wear cleats of any kind. Running shoes are acceptable but may lack grip for quick stops and pivots.<br>
        <strong>For sand sessions:</strong> Barefoot play is standard, but sand socks are highly recommended for added comfort, protection against hot or abrasive sand, and improved grip.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Wear weather-appropriate athletic clothing that allows for ease of movement. Moisture-wicking shirts, shorts, and tank tops are ideal for outdoor sessions in warm weather. For colder days, consider bringing layers (e.g., long sleeves, sweatpants, or lightweight athletic jackets).</li>
    <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Bring sunscreen, a hat or visor, and sunglasses to stay protected during outdoor play. Hydration is equally important, so a refillable water bottle is a must.</li>
</ul>

<!-- General Reminders -->
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: left;">General Reminders:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; list-style-type: disc; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left;">
    <li><strong>Label Your Equipment:</strong> Mark your volleyball and personal items with your name to avoid mix-ups with other participants.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Prepared for the Elements (Outdoor Sessions):</strong> Weather can change quickly, so consider bringing additional items like towels, extra layers, and a small sports bag to store your gear.</li>
    <li><strong>Mind Your Safety:</strong> Avoid jewelry, watches, or accessories that could cause injuries to yourself or others during play.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left;">
