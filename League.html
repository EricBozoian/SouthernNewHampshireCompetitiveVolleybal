        Each team plays 14 regular-season games followed by playoffs.<br>

        Maximum of five teams. Spots are limited, so secure your place early!
    </p>
    <p><strong>Rules & Fair Play:</strong><br>
        Cheating of any kind is strictly prohibited and will be enforced by Eric Bozoian. Teams or players found violating the rules will receive one warning, after which participation may be forfeited without a refund. Decisions regarding forfeits will be determined at Eric's discretion.
