            <h3>About Yankee Tournaments:</h3>
            <p>Southern New Hampshire Competitive Volleyball (SNHCVB) hosts Yankee-sanctioned tournaments at Girls Inc. of New Hampshire, offering a range of competitive formats, including Reverse Co-Ed (RCO), Men’s, and Women’s divisions. These events are held in accordance with the rules and standards set by the Yankee Volleyball Association, a branch of USA Volleyball, which promotes fair and competitive play across New England.
At SNHCVB, we provide tournaments that are challenging and enjoyable for everyone. Players receive individual ratings that are used to ensure balanced team compositions, maintaining fairness and competitiveness in every match.
Tournament Formats
Reverse Co-Ed (RCO): Teams are co-ed, but women hit on the front row, and men serve from behind the attack line, adding a unique twist to the game.
Men’s Division: Competitive tournaments designed specifically for men’s teams, adhering to USAV men’s height standards.
Women’s Division: Exclusive tournaments for women’s teams, featuring USAV women’s height standards and competition formats.
Our tournaments follow the official USA Volleyball rules and Yankee Volleyball Association’s guidelines, which help us maintain the integrity and professionalism of each event.</p>
