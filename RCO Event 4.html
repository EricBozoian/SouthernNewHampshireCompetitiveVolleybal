   <h3>Event Overview</h3>
   <p>
      <strong>When you sign up:</strong><br>
      Players register for specific positions on one of three teams, with six players per team. While you can choose your position and team during registration, Eric, the event host, reserves the right to reassign players to different teams to ensure fair and balanced gameplay. Your chosen position will remain the same even if your team changes.
   </p>
   <p>
      <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>
      Games are played to 18 points, win by 2. Teams rotate as follows: the first two fully assembled teams play the initial match, with the winning team staying on to face the third team. Each team plays two consecutive games before rotating off to referee the next match. The team not playing is responsible for refereeing, ensuring smooth and organized gameplay throughout the event.

   <h3>What is Reverse Co-Ed (RCO) Volleyball?</h3>
   <p>
      <strong>Please watch this video for a basic overview of RCO:</strong> 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/videos/d/1wg-OKSPmSqezGayM09CPuNCy-cRnBiGpCY6F3YX0XK4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">RCO Volleyball Overview Video</a>
      <br>
      It explains how to do the RCO rotation.
   </p>
   <p>
      Reverse Co-Ed (RCO) Volleyball is a super fun and unique way to enjoy volleyball! Here’s a quick rundown:
   </p>
   <p>
      <strong>Team Setup:</strong><br>
      Teams usually have 3 men and 3 women, but it can vary. Women play in the front row where they can attack and block at the net, while men play in the back row and can only attack from behind the 3-meter line.
   </p>
   <p>
      <strong>Rotation:</strong><br>
      Players rotate in the standard volleyball pattern (clockwise), but their roles stay the same. Women stay up front for attacks, and men stay at the back for defense and back-row hits.
   </p>
   <p>
      <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>
      Women have more chances to score with attacks and blocks at the net, and men focus on passing and back-row attacks. Plus, women don’t need to worry about blocking men’s attacks in the front row, making the game more dynamic and fun for everyone! For this event, the net will be set at women’s height, making it easier for ladies to show off their hits.
   </p>
   <p>
      Eric may make on-the-fly adjustments if the teams appear to be unbalanced during gameplay.
