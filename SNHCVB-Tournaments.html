            <h3>About SNHCVB Tournaments:</h3>
            <p>Southern New Hampshire Competitive Volleyball (SNHCVB) runs independently organized co-ed tournaments at Girls Inc. of NH in Nashua. Our tournaments follow a unique rating system that closely mirrors the Yankee Volleyball Association’s scale, ensuring fair and competitive play for all participants.
Unique Rating System
At SNHCVB, we use a customized rating scale to balance team compositions. Our ratings range from Expert Plus (XP), equivalent to a Yankee A- player, down to Novice Plus (NP), which mirrors a Yankee C-. This system ensures that teams remain competitive while accommodating players of varying skill levels. 
Co-Ed Format and Team Requirements
Our tournaments use a co-ed format, meaning both men and women are allowed to block and spike in the front row, which adds an exciting level of strategy to the game. Each team must have a minimum of six players, and there must always be at least two ladies on the court at all times. Teams can have up to nine players total, allowing flexibility for substitutions.
Rules and Structure
SNHCVB tournaments adhere to the official USA Volleyball (USAV) rules, with matches played to 21 points and each round consisting of two games. The top three teams will enter the playoffs, with the first-seed team receiving a bye in the first round.
By maintaining a co-ed environment and enforcing balanced team compositions, we ensure competitive, enjoyable matches for all participants.
