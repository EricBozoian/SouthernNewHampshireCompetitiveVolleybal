        <h3>About SNHCVB</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Southern NH Competitive Volleyball! We take pride in providing a high level of competitive play while fostering a welcoming and balanced environment. Our hosts assemble teams based on skill and position knowledge, ensuring every game is both fun and challenging.
At SNHCVB, we offer a variety of volleyball events, including indoor 6v6 tournaments, indoor drop-in co-ed volleyball, Reverse Co-Ed (RCO) volleyball, as well as grass 4v4 and 2v2 events and grass tournaments. Our primary goal is to keep the cost of all our events as low as possible, while still providing prizes and great experiences. Any funds collected above the costs of running our events go directly toward prizes and equipment to enhance the volleyball experience. Our primary goal is not to make a profit. There are no membership fees or long-term commitments â€“ just great volleyball at a great price.
